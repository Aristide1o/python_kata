    Algorithm description (simple greedy algorithm):
        1. Sort the list of books
        2. Create an ordered list of 5 items, each item is the count of each book in the basket, from book 1 to book 5
        5. Iterate through the list until the sum of the items is 0 (empty basket). Per iteration:
            a. add 1 to a discount ID for each book of a different type
            b. remove 1 for the count of that book
            c. the discount ID is both the count of items, and the index of the discount. At the end of the iteration,
               multiply the two and the item price (8) and add that to the total price
